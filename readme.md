## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate advanced .NET skills through the development of a scalable, secure, and maintainable parcel management API. It follows Clean Architecture principles and leverages patterns such as Repository and Specification to promote separation of concerns, testability, and flexibility.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C# (.NET 8+)
- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core Web API
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core (MySQL)
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer Token
- **Testing:** xUnit (integration-ready)
- **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI

---

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture

```
src/
├── ParcelManagement.Api          # Presentation Layer (Controllers, DTOs, Middleware)
├── ParcelManagement.Core         # Domain Layer (Entities, Specifications, Services, Interfaces)
├── ParcelManagement.Infrastructure # Infrastructure Layer (EF Core DbContext, Migrations, Repositories)
```

- **API Layer:** Handles HTTP requests, routing, and authentication/authorization.
- **Core Layer:** Contains business/domain logic, service interfaces, entities, and specifications.
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Implements repositories, database context, and migrations.

### Key Patterns

- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access and enables easy mocking for tests.
- **Specification Pattern:** Encapsulates query logic for complex filtering and business rules.
- **DTO Pattern:** Decouples internal models from API contracts.
- **Dependency Injection:** Ensures loose coupling and testability.
- **Middleware:** Centralized error handling and API exception management.

---

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Separation of Concerns:** Layers for API, domain, and data access.
- **SOLID Principles:** Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.
- **Async/Await:** All I/O operations are asynchronous for scalability.
- **Unit of Work (via EF Core):** Ensures transactional integrity.
- **Automated Migrations:** Database schema managed via code.
- **Strong Validation:** Data annotations and specification-based checks.
- **Security:** JWT authentication, password hashing, role-based access.
- **Environment-Based Configuration:** Secure secrets and connection strings.

---

## Features

- User registration and authentication (secure password hashing)
- JWT-based authorization
- Resident unit and parcel CRUD operations
- Parcel tracking and status management
- API documentation with Swagger

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/qawitherev/parcel-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   - Default is MySQL; configure your connection string in `appsettings.json`.

3. **Apply migrations**
   ```sh
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the API**
   ```sh
   dotnet run --project src/ParcelManagement.Api
   ```

5. **Access Swagger UI**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger` (default port may vary).
