# 🔧 Understanding Fixtures in Software Testing

## What is a Fixture? 🤔
A fixture is a mechanism to set up and manage test dependencies, allowing us to prepare a known good state for our tests and inject required dependencies where needed.

## Real-World Analogy ☕
Imagine making a latte:
- Instead of manually steaming milk each time
- We use an espresso machine to consistently prepare and inject steamed milk
- This ensures consistency and efficiency

## Programming Example 🖥️
Consider a web scraping scenario:
```csharp
class Scraper {
    private readonly ScraperTool _tool;
    // Dependency injection via fixture
}
```

## Project Context 📝
In this project:
- We initially created a Fixture class for unit testing
- However, we opted not to use it due to shared database context concerns
- The code remains for educational purposes

## How Fixtures Work in Testing 🔍
1. Implements `IDisposable` for resource cleanup
2. Fixture class sets up:
   - DbContext
   - Repositories
   - Services
3. Proper disposal of DbContext through `Dispose()`
4. Test classes implement `<T>`
5. Setup occurs once per test class
6. Cleanup happens at class completion

## Why We Changed Course ⚠️
- Shared database context led to non-isolated tests
- Planning to migrate to `IAsyncLifetime` for better test isolation
- Future documentation will cover the new approach

> Note: This pattern works well for isolated resources but requires careful consideration with shared resources like databases.
