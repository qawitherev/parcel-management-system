# 🚀 Angular Frontend for Parcel Management System

Welcome to the **Angular Frontend** of the Parcel Management System! This project is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly interface for managing parcels efficiently. Here's an overview of the architecture, design patterns, and services used in this project.

---

## 🎨 Architecture Overview

Our Angular application is structured to ensure modularity and scalability. Here's a breakdown:

- **Modules**: The app is divided into feature modules like `AuthModule`, `DashboardModule`, and `TrackingModule`.
- **Routing**: We use Angular's powerful SPA routing system, with lazy-loaded modules for optimal performance. Check out our [Angular Routing Guide](./readme/angular-routing.md) for more details.
- **Component-Based Design**: Each feature is encapsulated in its own component, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
- **Global Styles**: Leveraging TailwindCSS for consistent and responsive design. Global styles are managed in `styles.css`.

## 🛡️ Design Patterns

We follow industry-standard Angular design patterns:

1. **Component-Driven Development**:
   - Components control the UI and are defined with HTML and CSS.
   - Example: The `AppComponent` serves as the root component.

2. **Service-Oriented Architecture**:
   - Shared logic is encapsulated in services, making it reusable and testable.
   - Services are injected into components and other services using Angular's DI system.

3. **Guards in Routing**:
   - Route guards ensure secure navigation.
   - Example: Guards are used to verify user authentication and roles. Learn more in our [Guard Documentation](./readme/angular-routing.md).

## 🔧 Key Features and Services

- **Bootstrap Application**:
  - The app is bootstrapped in `main.ts` using `bootstrapApplication`.

- **Dynamic Routing**:
  - Routes are dynamically configured in `app.routes.ts`. For instance:
    ```typescript
    { path: 'dashboard', loadChildren: () => import('./features/dashboard/dashboard-module').then(m => m.DashboardModule) }
    ```

- **Test-Driven Development**:
  - Unit tests are written for all major components and services. Example: `app.spec.ts`.

- **Global Styles**:
  - Placeholder styles and TailwindCSS integration in `styles.css`.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the App

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
2. Visit `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

### 🧪 Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Use Karma for unit testing:
  ```bash
  ng test
  ```
- **End-to-End Tests**: Run E2E tests:
  ```bash
  ng e2e
  ```

### 🏗️ Building the App

- Build for production:
  ```bash
  ng build --prod
  ```
- The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
